# CrackStation (V1.0.4)
Crackstation is a password cracking station that uses sha1 encoding. It is able to crack passwords that satisfy this range [a-zA-Z0-9] of single characters and are encrypted using SHA-1. It can also crack any password that is up to two characters long and satisfies any two characters in the range [a-zA-Z0-9] and is encrypted using SHA-1. It now can crack any password that is up to three characters. The purpose of this Crackstation is to understand the workflow of encryption and decryption of cracking stations. The working principle is in the swift file named Crackstation.

## How to Use this library
Step 1: Import the CrackStation
<pre><code>import CrackStation</code></pre>

Step 2: Initialize CrackStation object 
<pre><code>testObject = CrackStation()</code></pre>

Step 3: Start Cracking process 
Provide a SHA-1 digest into the function and see if it spit out a plain-text password. If the CrackStation couldn't find a matching password, it will return nil.
<pre><code>
hash1 = "df211ccdd94a63e0bcb9e6ae427a249484a49d60"
testObject.decrypt(shaHash: hash1)
decrypt result: "as"
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
hash1 = "df211ccdd94a63e0bcb9e6ae427a249484a49d20"
testObject.decrypt(shaHash: hash1)
decrypt result: "asA"
</code></pre>
